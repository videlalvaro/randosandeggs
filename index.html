<p>This website was inspired by Twitter's very own species of Randos & Eggs. Since it seems they have too much time to be arguing relentlessly with strangers, perhaps we could put some of that time to good use by recommending them some good literature.</p>

<p>As I think of new titles, I'll be adding them to the list down here.</p>

          <dd>Donald Knuth's book is a classic of Computer Science. A very thorough book that covers many areas of the field. It's filed with exercises that can keep you busy for months. It's also a very expensive set of books, which is just reminder that not everyone can have access to higher education. Still you might be lucky enough to find it at your public library.</dd>
